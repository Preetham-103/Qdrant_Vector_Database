Semantic Search with Vector Database using MixedBread Model
This project implements a semantic search system using a vector database, powered by the MixedBread model and text embeddings. It aims to improve information retrieval by representing text data as vectors, which enables context-aware search results.

Installation
To run this project locally, follow the steps below:

Clone the repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/semantic-search-mixedbread.git
Navigate to the project directory

bash
Copy code
cd semantic-search-mixedbread
Install dependencies You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Train the Model
Before running the search system, you need to train the MixedBread model. Use the following command:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Run the Semantic Search
Once the model is trained, you can run the semantic search by executing:

bash
Copy code
python search.py
This will allow you to input a query, and the system will return the most relevant results based on the semantic meaning of the input.

Technologies Used
MixedBread Model: A deep learning-based model for processing and embedding text data.
Vector Database: A database designed for storing and querying vectors.
Python: The main programming language used for implementation.
Libraries:
numpy
pytorch
faiss (for vector search)
transformers (for text embedding)
How It Works
Text Embeddings: The text data is transformed into high-dimensional vectors using the MixedBread model. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text, allowing for a more nuanced comparison during the search phase.

Vector Search: The embeddings are stored in a vector database (like FAISS). When a user submits a query, the system compares the queryâ€™s embedding with the stored vectors to retrieve the most relevant results.
